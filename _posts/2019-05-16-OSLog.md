This article is introducing the `Unified Logging` system and how to use it to measure performace.

# Unified Logging

From the document:
> The unified logging system provides a single, efficient, performant API for capturing messaging across all levelsof the system.

The Unified Logging uses Activity Tracing for performance, consolicates kernel and user-space logging.

## Why using it

- Compressing data
- Deferring work and data collection
- Managing log message lifecycle

We want as much logging on all the time as possible.

## Key Features

- Improved categorization and filtering of log messages
- Logging system collects caller information
- New Builtin type specifiers - simplifies log message preparation
- New Console application and command-line tool (graph)
- Supported on macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS and Simulators
- Support for Objective C, C++, C and Swift

## Logging Concepts

### Adption

- Build with the macOS 10.12, iOS 10.0 or watchOS 3.0 SDK
- Legacy APIs(NSLog, as_log_message, syslog...) redirected into new system
- Log data will be in new format and location

### New File Formats

- Log data is kept in a compressed binary format: `.tracev3` files
- Stored under `/var/db/diagnostics` with support in `/var/db/uuidtext`
- `.logarchive` format for portability of logs (collection of log data, easier to transfer to email or ...)

### Subsystems and Categories

- Log messages can be associated with a subsystem and category
- Can be used to control how log messages are fitered and displayed
- A subsystem can contain multiple categories

Your application will have own subsystems and categories as needed.

### Logging Behavior

Each log message has a level determined by the API used

- Three basic levels -- Default, Info, Debug
- Two special levels -- Fault, Error

Each basic levels has two characteristics that can be set for system, subsystem, or category

- Need to check if it is enabled (Default messages are always enabled)
- Is it stored to disk or memory? (Fault or Error are always stored to disk.)

The levels are hierarchical

- Setting Debug to go to disk implies that Info will also go to disk

Behavior can be customized by installing profiles or, on macOS, via log command

### Standard Behavior

| Message Level  | Enabled  | Destination   |
| :----- | :-----| :----- |
| DEFAULT LEVEL     | ALWAYS | DISK |
| INFO LEVEL | YES | MEMORY |
| DEBUG LEVEL | NO | N/A |
| ERROR | ALWAYS | DISK |
| FAULT | ALWAYS | DISK |

### Privacy

Prevent accidental logging of Personally Identifiable Information(PII)

### Faults and Errors

- Errors -- represent issues discovered within a given application/library
- Faults -- represent more global problems in the system
- Faults and Error log information is captured into a seperate set of log files (They will exsit longer than normal logs)

### Architecture

### Type Formatters

![type_formatter](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/type_formatter.png)

## Parameter Privacy

Privacy is handled on a parameter by parameter basis
`Scalars` and `Static strings` are assumed to be public
`Dynamic strings`, `collections` and `objects` are assumed to be private

## Demo

Here is the changing :

## Activity API Improvements

Activites are not objects that can be stored and re-used

- Direct control of activity relationships during creation

New API to auto-scope activites within the code

## Tools

### Console

- View live content form a system
- Open log archives
- New Activity centric view of logging and tracing
- Advanced filtering and searching
- Device support

### log Command Line Tool

## Logging Etiquette

- Ensure messages contain only information useful for debugging
- Leverage built-in formatters
- Avoid creating wrapper functions for `os_log` APIs
- Log only what you need from collections (Dictionaries, Arrays, etc)
- Avoid logging in tight code loops

## Suggest

- Use `os_log` to log critical details to help debug issues
- Use `os_log_info` for additional info that will be captured during error or fault
- Use `os_log_debug` for high-volume debugging during development
- Use `os_log_error` to cause additional information capture from app
- Use `os_log_fault` to cause additional information capture from system

## Using `sysdiagnose`

`sysdiagnose` is the preferred method to capture data for bug reports

- Unified logging data in `system_logs.archive`

Use `key-chord` to trigger
`sysdiagnose` on Apple Watch will trigger on both Apple Watch and iPhone
Transfer from device using iTunes

Here are some `key-chord`s

# Measure Performance

## `os_signpost`

Instruments can take the data that `signposts` produce and you could check what your program is doing.

Here is an example:

![os_signpost](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/os_signpost.png)

`os_signpost` allows to mark the beginning and the end(`.begin` & `.end`).

## Measure Asynchronous Operation

- Signpost Name
- Signpost ID -- tell overlapping operations apart
    ![signpost_id](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/signpost_id.png)
    - Making Signpost ID ()
    ![make_signpost_id](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/make_signpost_id.png)
    - process-scoped
    - making from object is convenient if we have the same object at `.begin` and `.end`
    - Demo
        ![signpost_id_ex](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/signpost_id_ex.png)

## Add Metadata to Signpost

- Add context to the `.begin` and `.end`
- Be able to pass arguments with `os_log` format string literal
- Pass many arguments with different types
- Pass dynamic strings

## Add Independent Event

`os_signpost` have `.event` type
Marking a single point

## Conditionally Enable Signpost

Signposts are lightweight

- Built to minimize observer effect
- Built for fine-grained measurement in a short time span

`OSLog.disabled`

![signpost_enable](/images/2019-05-16-OSLog/signpost_enable.png)

## Instruments

- Blank -> add `os_signpost`
- Able to retrieve from `Summary` part
- Able to `Record` the action
