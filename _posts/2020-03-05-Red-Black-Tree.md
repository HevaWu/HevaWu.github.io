`Red-Black Tree` is a binary search tree. It add one more color property at each node, which would be `red` or `black`. By using the color, red-black tree can make sure there is no route length larger than 2*other route. Thus it is almost balanced.

The property:

- Each node is either red or black
- Root node is black
- Each child node(NIL) is black
- If one node is red, then its 2 children is black
- From each node to its successor node, contains same amount of black node(`black-height` which should at most `2(lg(n+1))`)

## Operations

For a binary search tree, SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, PRECESSOR would take `O(logn)` time. `Red-black tree` is also a binary search tree, so in these operations, the time is same. For INSERT & DELETE, we will discuss later how to do it in O(logn) time and also keep the edited one as a red-black tree.

## Rotation

In INSERT & DELETE, it will modify the tree, which might not satisfy the above requirements. For keeping the edited one also as a red-black tree, we could `rotate` the tree.

### Pseudocode

```
// LEFT-ROTATE(T, x)
y = x.right  			// set y
x.right = y.left		// turn y's left subtree into x's right subtree
if y.left != T.nil
	y.left.p = x
y.p = x.p				// link x's parent to y
if x.p == T.nil
	T.root = y
elseif x == x.p.left
	x.p.left = y
else x.p.right == y
y.left = x				// put x on y's left
x.p = y
```

The `left-rotation` & `right-rotation` can be done in `O(1)` time. In rotation operation, only change the pointer, other properties are keeping previously.

## Insert

Insert the node as normal insertion first, then set its color to `red`, then for keeping the red-black tree property, use RB-INSERT-FIXUP to update the node color & rotate the node.

### Pseudocode

```
// RB-INSERT(T, z)
y = T.nil
x = T.root
while x != T.nil
	y = x
	if z.key < x.key
		x = x.left
	else x = x.right
z.p = y
if y == T.nil
	T.root = z
elseif z.key < y.key
	y.left = z
else y.right = z
z.left = T.nil
z.right = T.nil
z.color = red
RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T,z)

// RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T,z)
while z.p.color == red
	if z.p == z.p.p.left
		y = z.p.p.right
		if y.color == red 		// case 1
			z.p.color = black
			y.color = black
			z.p.p.color = red
			z = z.p.p
		elseif z == z.p.right	// case 2
			z = z.p
			LEFT-ROTATE(T,z)
		z.p.color = black		// case 3
		z.p.p.color = red
		RIGHT-ROTATE(T, z.p.p)
	else same as then clause with right & left exchanged
T.root.color = blcak
```

- Case 1: z.p.p.right is red
- Case 2: z.p.p.right is black && z is a right node
- Case 3: z.p.p.right is black && z is a left node

Time complexity: since the height of a red-black tree is `O(lgn)`, only at case 1, pointer will move up, so at most O(lgn), otherwise, we will only run while for 2 times.

## Delete

### Pseudocode

```
// RB-TRANSPLANT(T, u, v)
if u.p == T.nil
	T.root = v
elseif u == u.p.left
	u.p.left = v
else u.p.right = v
v.p = u.p

// RB-DELETE(T, z)
y = z
yoriginalcolor = y.color
if z.left == T.nil
	x = z.right
	RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)
elseif z.right == T.nil
	x = z.left
	RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.left)
else y = TREE-MINIMUM(z.right)
	yoriginalcolor = y.color
	x = y.right
	if y.p == z
		x.p = y
	else RB-TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)
		y.right = z.right
		y.right.p = y
	RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, y)
	y.left = z.left
	y.left.p = y
	y.color = z.color
if yoriginalcolor == black
	RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)

// RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)
while x != T.root && x.color == black
	if x == x.p.left
		w = x.p.right
		if w.color == red									// case 1
			w.color = black
			w.p.color = red
			LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p)
			w = x.p.right
		if w.left.color == black && w.right.color == black	// case 2
			w.color = red
			x = x.p
		elseif w.right.color == black						// case 3
			w.left.color = black
			w.color = red
			RIGHT-ROTATE(T, w)
			w = x.p.right
		w.color = x.p.color									// case 4
		x.p.color = black
		w.right.color = black
		LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p)
		x = T.root
	else same s then clause with right and left exchange
x.color = black
```

- case 1: x brother w is red
- case 2: x brother w is black && w's 2 children is black
- case 3: x brother w is black, w's left children is red, w's right children is black
- case 4: x brother w is black, w's right children is red

Time complexity: case 1,3,4 have constant color changing, and at most rotate 3 times, case 2 is the only case while would be repeat, pointer x will move up at most `O(lgn)` times. Do at most 3 rotations.
