Memory of a Computer is any physical device which is capable of storing information whether it is large or small and stores ite temporarily or permanently.

`RAM(Random Access Memory)` is a type of volatile memory that stores informaiton for a short interval of time.
`EPROM(Erasable Programmable ROM)` is a non-volatile memory.

Memory can be either volatile or non-volatile. `Volatile` memory is a type of memeory that `loses` its contents when the computer or hardware deice is `switched off`.

## Units of Memory

A computer processor is made up of multiple decisive circuits, each one of which may be either OFF or ON. These two states in terms of memory are represented by a 0 or 1. In order to count higher than 1, such `bits` (Binary digitS) are suspended together.

```s
1 byte = 8 bits
1 byte -> (00_000_000 to 11_111_111)
```

**Types of various Units of Memory**

- Byte -> abbreviation is B
- Kilo Byte -> 1024 bytes (2^10) -> abbreviation: K or KB
- Mega Byte -> 1_048_576 bytes (1024^2) -> abbreviation: MB
- Giga Byte -> 1_073_741_824 bytes (1024^3) -> abbreviation: GB
- Tera Byte -> 1_099_511_627_776 bytes (1024 GB) -> abbreviation: TB
- Peta Byte -> 1_125_899_906_842_624 bytes (1024 TB) -> abbreviation: PB
- Exa Byte -> 1_152_921_504_606_846_976 bytes (1024 PB) -> abbreviation: EB
- Zetta Byte -> 1_180_591_620_717_411_303_424 bytes (1024 EB) -> abbreviation: ZB
- Yotta Byte -> 1_208_925_819_614_629_174_706_176 bytes (1024 ZB) -> abbreviation: YB

**Note**: Not confuse these two:

- `12800 KB RAM` refers to the amount of main memory the computer provides to its CPU.
- `128 MB disk` symbolizes the amount of space that is available for the storage of files, data, and other type of permanent information.
