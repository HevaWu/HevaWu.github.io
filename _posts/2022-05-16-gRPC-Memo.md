## Overview

> gRPC can use `protocol buffers` as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format.
>
> In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.

### Trial

```sh
# run the server
dart bin/server.dart

# open another terminal, run the client
dart bin/client.dart
```

## Basic Tutorial

### Define the Service

- simple RPC
- server-side streaming RPC
- client-side streaming RPC
- bidirectional streaming RPC

```sh
service RouteGuide {
    # simple RPC
    rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature) {}

    # server to client streaming RPC
    rpc ListFeatures(Rectangle) returns (stream Feature) {}

    # client to server streaming RPC
    rpc RecordRoute(stream Point) returns (RouteSummary) {}

    # bidirectional streaming RPC
    rpm RouteChat(stream RouteNote) returns (stream RouteNote) {}
}
```

### Create the Server

- implementing service interface generated from service definition: doing actual work of our service
- running a gRPC server to listen for requests from clients and dispatch them to the right service implementation

### Start the Server

- Create instance of the gRPC server using `grpc.Server()`, giving list of service implementation
- Call `serve()` on server to start lisenting for requests, optionally passing in the address and port to listen on. Server will continue to server requests async until `shutdown()` is called on it

### Create the Client

- need to create gRPC `channel` to communicate with server
- use `ChannelOptions` to set TLS options for the channel
- need a client `stub` to perform RPCs
- use `CallOptions` to set auth credentials when a service require 

```dart
final channel = ClientChannel(
    '127.0.0.1', 
    port: 8080, 
    options: const ChannelOptions(credentials: ChannelCredentials.insecure())
);
stub = RouteGuideClient(channel, options: CallOptions(timeout: Duration(seconds: 30)));
```
