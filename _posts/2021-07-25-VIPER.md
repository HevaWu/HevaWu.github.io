The VIPER architectural pattern is an alternative to MVC or MVVM.

- `View`: Class that has all the code to show the app interface to the user and get their responses. Upon receiving a response View alerts the Presenter.
- `Presenter`: Nucleus of a module. It gets user response from the View and works accordingly. The only class to communicate with all the other components. Calls the router for wire-framing, Interactor to fetch data (network calls or local data calls), view to update the UI.
- `Interactor`: Has the business logic of an app. e.g if business logic depends on making network calls then it is Interactorâ€™s responsibility to do so.
- `Router`: Does the wire-framing. Listens from the presenter about which screen to present and executes that.
- `Entity`: Contains plain model classes used by the Interactor.

`VIPER` goes a step further by separating the view logic from the data model logic. Only the `presenter` talks to the `view`, and only the `interactor` talks to the `model` (`entity`). The `presenter` and `interactor` coordinate with each other. The `presenter` is concerned with display and user action, and the `interactor` is concerned with manipulating the data.
