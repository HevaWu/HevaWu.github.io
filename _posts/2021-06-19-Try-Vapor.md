I've heard Swift on Server for a while, but never try it before. So I'd like to try to use it and memo some in this blog. Here is some benefits they wrote in the doc:

> - Cloud services built with Swift have a small memory footprint (measured in MB)–especially when compared to other popular server languages with automatic memory management.
> - Services built with Swift are also CPU-efficient, given the language’s focus on performance.
> - Using Swift also helps streamline continuous delivery pipelines, since you incur less wait time for new versions of the service fleet to come online.
> - quick boot times make Swift a perfect fit for serveless applications such as Cloud Functions or Lambda with negligible cold start times.

After doing some research, I notice the major Swift framework is [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/). That's I'd like to try it at first. Basically I will follow with the guide, and will memo some if I met any error.

# Hello World Vapor

```sh
# install
$ brew install vapor

# new project
$ vapor new Try-Vapor-Hello-World -n
$ cd Try-Vapor-Hello-World

# open in Xcode
$ open Package.swift
```

Run with `My Mac` target, check console:

```sh
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

with ⬇️ `routes` settings

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/routes.png#simulator)

open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` ⬇️

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/works.png)

open `http://localhost:8080/hello` ⬇️

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/hello.png)

It will also show request-id info in console as bellow ⬇️

## Terminal

Swift Package can also run in terminal by using:

```sh
$ swift run
```

It will also build and run project. It also show dependency fetching info and at the end, show connection info like ⬇️

```sh
[1511/1511] Build complete!
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Here is my test project: <https://github.com/HevaWu/Try-Vapor-Hello-World>.

# Shiba Random Vapor

Next step, I'd like to try to use [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started/) in Vapor. Here is my test project: <https://github.com/HevaWu/Vapor-Shiba-Random>

Same as above, create one new project by:

```sh
$ vapor new Vapor-Shiba-Random
# select `y` at ``Would you like to use Leaf?``
```

The generated template have bellow problem for now:

- `routes.swift` has a redundant route, we need to remove it to use
- `Package.swift` target dependency missing `Leaf` module, we need to manually add it
- manually add `app.views.use(.leaf)` in `configure.swift` to tell system we are using leaf

Next step, we want to build it, after running, we notice the `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index` show error:

```sh
open(file:oFlag:mode:): No such file or directory (errno: 2)
```

It means it cannot find proper leaf template place. For solving it, we need to set [custom working directory](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/xcode/#custom-working-directory) to let vapor find it.

For now, the template paths should show well. We can try to add more template and render it now!

## Add Welcome Page

First, for testing adding images and embedded child leaf, I add one `/welcome` for try.

I set my `base.leaf` and `welcome.leaf` as bellow:

```html
<!-- base.leaf -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>#import("title")</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/syntax.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello! #import("title")</h1>
    #import("body")
</body>

</html>

<!-- welcome.leaf -->
#extend("base"):
    #export("title"):
    It works!
    #endexport

    #export("body"):
        <div class="welcome">
            <img src="/images/hello.png">
        </div>
    #endexport
#endextend
```

Here are several notes:

- manually create `/Public` folder first, and put required server sharing files into it
- by using `/styles` and `/images`, we need to enable `/Public` [FileMiddleware](https://api.vapor.codes/vapor/main/Vapor/FileMiddleware/) first.
- use `extend`, `export`, `import` for sharing data between parent and child pages. (if we directly search online, there are some site is using `set` `get` which vapor is not support them anymore)
