I've heard Swift on Server for a while, but never try it before. So I'd like to try to use it and memo some in this blog. Here is some benefits they wrote in the doc:

> - Cloud services built with Swift have a small memory footprint (measured in MB)‚Äìespecially when compared to other popular server languages with automatic memory management.
> - Services built with Swift are also CPU-efficient, given the language‚Äôs focus on performance.
> - Using Swift also helps streamline continuous delivery pipelines, since you incur less wait time for new versions of the service fleet to come online.
> - quick boot times make Swift a perfect fit for serveless applications such as Cloud Functions or Lambda with negligible cold start times.

After doing some research, I notice the major Swift framework is [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/). That's I'd like to try it at first. Basically I will follow with the guide, and will memo some if I met any error.

# Hello World Vapor

```sh
# install
$ brew install vapor

# new project
$ vapor new Try-Vapor-Hello-World -n
$ cd Try-Vapor-Hello-World

# open in Xcode
$ open Package.swift
```

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/init.png#simulator)

Run with `My Mac` target, check console:

```sh
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

with ‚¨áÔ∏è `routes` settings

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/routes.png#simulator)

open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` ‚¨áÔ∏è

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/works.png)

open `http://localhost:8080/hello` ‚¨áÔ∏è

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/hello.png)

It will also show request-id info in console as bellow ‚¨áÔ∏è

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/request.png#simulator)

## Terminal

Swift Package can also run in terminal by using:

```sh
$ swift run
```

It will also build and run project. It also show dependency fetching info and at the end, show connection info like ‚¨áÔ∏è

```sh
[1511/1511] Build complete!
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Here is my test project: <https://github.com/HevaWu/Try-Vapor-Hello-World>.

# Shiba Random Vapor

Next step, I'd like to try to use [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started/) in Vapor. Here is my test project: <https://github.com/HevaWu/Vapor-Shiba-Random>

It will run like:
![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/list.png)

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/shiba-list.gif)

Same as above, create one new project by:

```sh
$ vapor new Vapor-Shiba-Random
# select `y` at ``Would you like to use Leaf?``
```

The generated template have bellow problem for now:

- `routes.swift` has a redundant route, we need to remove it to use
- `Package.swift` target dependency missing `Leaf` module, we need to manually add it
- manually add `app.views.use(.leaf)` in `configure.swift` to tell system we are using leaf

Next step, we want to build it, after running, we notice the `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index` show error:

```sh
open(file:oFlag:mode:): No such file or directory (errno: 2)
```

It means it cannot find proper leaf template place. For solving it, we need to set [custom working directory](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/xcode/#custom-working-directory) to let vapor find it.

For now, the template paths should show well. We can try to add more template and render it now!

## Add Welcome Page

First, for testing adding images and embedded child leaf, I add one `/welcome` for try.

I set my `base.leaf` and `welcome.leaf` as bellow:

```html
<!-- base.leaf -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>#import("title")</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/syntax.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello! #import("title")</h1>
    #import("body")
</body>

</html>

<!-- welcome.leaf -->
#extend("base"):
    #export("title"):
    It works!
    #endexport

    #export("body"):
        <div class="welcome">
            <img src="/images/hello.png">
        </div>
    #endexport
#endextend
```

Here are several notes:

- manually create `/Public` folder first, and put required server sharing files into it
- by using `/styles` and `/images`, we need to enable `/Public` [FileMiddleware](https://api.vapor.codes/vapor/main/Vapor/FileMiddleware/) first.
- use `extend`, `export`, `import` for sharing data between parent and child pages. (if we directly search online, there are some site is using `set` `get` which vapor is not support them anymore)

## Shiba List Page

Next Step, I'd like to fetch `get` request from the `http://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=100&urls=true&httpsUrls=true`.

*NOTE: Vapor API changed a lot for each major version. For now, the `Data(body.readableBytesView)` works at here. But, this behavior might be changed in later version.*

```swift
let future = req.client
    .get("http://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=100&urls=true&httpsUrls=true")
    .flatMapThrowing { res -> ShibaImageURLList? in
        guard let body = res.body else {
            return nil
        }
        let data = Data(body.readableBytesView)
        guard let jsonAsArr = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [Any] else {
            return nil
        }

        let list = jsonAsArr.compactMap { object -> ShibaImageURL? in
            if let str = object as? String {
                return ShibaImageURL(urlString: str)
            } else {
                return nil
            }
        }
        return ShibaImageURLList(list: list)
    }
```

This code will return a `EventLoopFuture<ShibaImageURLList?>` object now. And next step will be show list on our website.

```swift
.flatMap { list in
    req.view.render("shibalist", list)
}
```

*NOTE: NOT using `req.view.render("shibalist", future)`. It will throw error about `EventLoopFuture<Type> not from Encodable`. This actually means we should not directly use future object, instead, use `flatMap` to filter and render object properly.*

*NOTE: We need to use a `ShibaImageURLList` to wrap final response at here. If we directly use `[ShibaImageURL]`, system will throw error at the render page `LeafKit.LeafError.Reason.unsupportedFeature(\"You must use a top level dictionary or type for the context. Arrays are not allowed.\")` to inform we have to wrap it to a final response object.*

For now, the list can show well now. But I'd like to try if we can clean some code by using Controller. Vapor's [Folder Structure doc](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/folder-structure/#routesswift) mentioned:

> Controllers are great way of grouping together application logic. Most controllers have many functions that accept a request and return some sort of response.

For this request, I tried to make a Controller like:

```swift
final class ShibaController {
    func index(req: Request) -> EventLoopFuture<View> {
        let uri = URI(string: "http://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=100&urls=true&httpsUrls=true")
        return req.client
            .get(uri)
            .flatMapThrowing { res -> ShibaImageURLList in
                guard let body = res.body else {
                    return ShibaImageURLList.empty
                }
                let data = Data(body.readableBytesView)
                guard let jsonAsArr = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [Any] else {
                    return ShibaImageURLList.empty
                }

                let list = jsonAsArr
                    .compactMap { object -> ShibaImageURL? in
                        if let str = object as? String {
                            return ShibaImageURL(urlString: str)
                        } else {
                            return nil
                        }
                    }
                return ShibaImageURLList(list: list)
            }
            .flatMap { list in
                req.view.render("shibalist", list)
            }
    }
}
```

And call it in routes like:

```swift
let shibaController = ShibaController()
app.get("shibalist", use: shibaController.index(req:))
```

The rendered page is working same as previous code. Now, the page is good. But, we find we can customize the parameter in this `GET` request, ex: count, urls, etc. Maybe we can try to make a user input form, and parse parameter to this request to get list.

```swift
// define at Controller
func index(req: Request) -> EventLoopFuture<View> {
    return req.view.render("shibalistGetParam")
}

func getList(req: Request, uri: URI) -> EventLoopFuture<View> {
    return req.client
        .get(uri)
        ...
}

func postParams(req: Request) throws -> EventLoopFuture<View> {
    let content = try req.content.decode(ShibaListGetRequestContent.self)
    if var components = URLComponents(string: Self.baseURLString) {
        components.queryItems = [
            URLQueryItem(name: "count", value: content.count),
            URLQueryItem(name: "urls", value: content.urls.description),
            URLQueryItem(name: "httpUrls", value: content.httpsUrls.description),
        ]
        if let uriStr = components.string {
            let uri = URI(string: uriStr)
            return getList(req: req, uri: uri)
        }
    }

    // parse URI failed, back to welcome page
    return req.view.render("welcome")
}

// call in routes
app.post("shibalist-submit", use: shibaController.postParams(req:))
```

DONE!

# The End

It's very easy to use Vapor for generating some website, its logic is clean. But I'm thinking it might still under improvement/design, so its configuration is keep changing. We'd better to read its latest document to do our design, rather than search some existed project. (That's why bump major version changes ü§£)

Well, in general, as a Swift programmer, I'm very happy to see we can use Swift on Server development, and I'd like to keep watching its updates! ü§†
