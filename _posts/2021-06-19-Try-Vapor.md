I've heard Swift on Server for a while, but never try it before. So I'd like to try to use it and memo some in this blog. Here is some benefits they wrote in the doc:

> - Cloud services built with Swift have a small memory footprint (measured in MB)–especially when compared to other popular server languages with automatic memory management.
> - Services built with Swift are also CPU-efficient, given the language’s focus on performance.
> - Using Swift also helps streamline continuous delivery pipelines, since you incur less wait time for new versions of the service fleet to come online.
> - quick boot times make Swift a perfect fit for serveless applications such as Cloud Functions or Lambda with negligible cold start times.

After doing some research, I notice the major Swift framework is [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/). That's I'd like to try it at first. Basically I will follow with the guide, and will memo some if I met any error.

```sh
# install
$ brew install vapor

# new project
$ vapor new helloVapor -n
$ cd helloVapor

# open in Xcode
$ open Package.swift
```

Run with `My Mac` target, check console:

```sh
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

with ⬇️ `routes` settings

![](/images/2021-06-19-Try-Vapor/routes.png#simulator)

open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` ⬇️

open `http://localhost:8080/hello` ⬇️

It will also show request-id info in console as bellow ⬇️

## Terminal

Swift Package can also run in terminal by using:

```sh
$ swift run
```

It will also build and run project. It also show dependency fetching info and at the end, show connection info like ⬇️

```sh
[1511/1511] Build complete!
[ NOTICE ] Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Here is my test project: <https://github.com/HevaWu/Try-Vapor-Hello-World>
