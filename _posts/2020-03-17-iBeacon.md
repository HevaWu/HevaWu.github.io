## Overview

iBeacon was introduced in iOS 7(2013), it enable new location awareness possibblities for apps. It is beased on BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) proximity sensing byb transmitting a universally unique identifier.

This allows an iOS device to determine when it has entered or left the region. There are both hardware and software components to consider when using iBeacon.

> iBeacon transmitters provide a way to create and monitor beacons that advertise certain identifying information using Bluetooth low-energy wireless technology. Bluetooth low-energy beacons that advertise the same universally unique identifier (UUID) form a beacon region that your app can monitor through the Core Location region monitoring support. Beacons with the same UUID can be distinguished by the additional information they advertise. While a beacon is in range of a user’s device, apps can also monitor for the relative distance to the beacon.

## Audience

iBeacon has 3 different audiences.

1. App Developers
If you want to add new location awareness to your application, you would use the Core Location APIs in iOS to be notified when the iOS device has moved into or out of a beacon region. You can also determine approximate proximities to a device generating iBeacon advertisements. Everything you need to get started is included in the iOS SDK, no additional license is required.
2. People Deploying Devices With iBeacon Technology
Whether you manage a sports arena, a museum, a retail store, or any of the myriad other physical locations where beacons could be employed, you need to be aware of how these devices work, issues surrounding signal strength and materials, and understand how to calibrate and test your deployment. If you are interested in using the iBeacon Logo on signage at a venue, but will not make devices with iBeacon technology, you will need to obtain an iBeacon logo license before using the iBeacon logo. Please visit https:// developer.apple.com/ibeacon/ to apply for a license to use the iBeacon logo.
3. People Making Devices With iBeacon Technology
If you are interested in manufacturing devices with iBeacon technology, you will need to obtain a license before building these devices. Please visit https://developer.apple.com/ ibeacon/ to apply for an iBeacon license. Licensees receive access to technical specifications, a license to use the iBeacon logo, and the iBeacon Identity Guidelines.

## iBeacon Software - Core Location APIs

iBeacon define the regions with an identifier which allows beacons to bbe affixed to objects that are not tied to a single location.

When an iOS device detects a beacon’s signal, it uses the strength of the signal (RSSI, or Received Signal Strength Indication) to determine both proximity to the beacon, as well as the accuracy of its estimation of proximity. The stronger the signal, the more confident iOS can be about the proximity to the beacon. The weaker the signal, the less confident iOS is about the proximity to the beacon.

When an iOS device can clearly receive GPS signals, such as when a device is in the open outdoors with an unobstructed line of sight to the orbiting GPS satellites, the more accurately your location can be determined.

## Deploy iBeacon

iBeacon devices use BLE to broadcast signals. BLE is based on the 2.4 GHz frequency. The 2.4 GHz frequency can also be affected by water, which means human body will also affect signals.
